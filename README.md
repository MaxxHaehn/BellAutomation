# Bell Observatory Automation Script
This code is an attempt to create a fully-automated observatory experience with one click.
Observers create a TargetList.txt file using the template, and then running the AutomationScript.vbs script will trigger a filename input.
Users then input the target list file name (".txt"-inclusive), and the observatory will start up, run the targets, and shut down with no further user input.
